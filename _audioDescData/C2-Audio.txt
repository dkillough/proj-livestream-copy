[00:00:00] So we're looking at a very weird structure overall. White looks like to be they are up a knight and down a pawn in compensation. Other than that material is even. in terms of where pawns are placed. White has a pawn on a five, C four, D three, F four, G three, and H four Black has pawns every pawnis on the seventh rank except for the E pawn which is on E six. Black King is on E seven, uh, and the black bishop is on D six. Black also has a Rook on E eight and a rook on H eight as well as a bishop on C eight, a Knight on a eight and a Queen on D eight Whites. Pieces are a Rook on a one, a Rook on H one a Bishop on F one, a Bishop on E three, and a Queen on B three and Knights on as uh, F three and E four.

[00:01:14] White plays rook to H four black plays Bishop to E seven A four.

[00:01:27] White considers playing pawn to g4, but then plays pawn to H five instead. Black plays king F eight. Then white plays pawn g4. Then black plays pawn D five. Then white takes the pawn on D five with pawn on c4. 

[00:01:38] Then black re-captures on D five on D five with a pawn on E six, white considers moving the knight 

[00:01:47] on E four and then does move their knight from E four to D two black plays Bishop D seven attacking the rook on H four

[00:02:01] White does not seem to notice that their rook is under attack now. They just notice the rook is under attack and move rook H four to rook D four

[00:03:57] and does capture the rook on H seven with their rook.

[00:04:01] Black does not take the free rook and instead Moves their queen to F six, which attacks the rook 

[00:04:07] white moves the rook back to H four. 

[00:04:10] uh, black blunders their queen by playing black by playing Queen H three. Check

[00:04:18] white does not realize the queen is blundered and blocks the check by playing knight F three black plays Queen G two,
