[00:00:21] HBox tries to choose a character to play elite smash.

[00:00:32] But he decides with his main, Jigglypuff. He locks in. 

[00:01:01] He's fighting a villager player named Question mark 

[00:01:08] the stage is small battlefield

[00:01:13] first advantage state to box, continues to land pound Fairs

[00:01:23] the villager does manage to make it back but has eaten 81%. 

[00:01:30] Villager accidentally mashes up B mid stage and dies to a back air from H box

[00:01:38] H box pounds a tree.

[00:01:43] H box ends up off stage, but the Villager does not get the ledge trap. 

[00:01:50] H Box continues to pound in neutral.

[00:01:57] Both characters are just kind of running around the stage doing their own thing. H Box, still on his first stock. 

[00:02:13] Box takes a little more damage and finally loses stock one. 

[00:02:26] Ooh, H box tanks the grab, and almost gets converted on the platform from missing a tech. 

[00:02:32] He misses a random rest and gets up smashed at 14, taking all the way up to 52% damage.

[00:02:48] takes you up to-

[00:02:53] He lands the drill rest 

[00:02:57] Scratches his head and looks at chat. 

[00:03:06] He misses the sing and takes an F smash from the villager, the stock count is one one. 

[00:03:48] HBox dies to Villager up smash ending the game. 

[00:04:07] HBox is sitting on the losing screen, 

[00:04:17] and decides to rematch the villager.

[00:04:32] And a new game between the two begins.

[00:04:46] Immediately the villager takes advantage, dealing 42 to Hbox. 

[00:04:58] H Box almost gets a crazy rest combo, but drops.

[00:05:11] He gets drill rest, 

[00:05:27] The villager continues to Nair in neutral while hbox follows in suit. 

[00:05:47] The villager does end up taking HBox's stock with the axe 

[00:05:53] They are two-two. 

[00:05:58] H Box lands another drill rest, but doesn't finish the villager off, so he eats an F smash -- up smash.
