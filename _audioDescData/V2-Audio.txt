[00:00:02] Um, so perspective has changed to Jett from Viper and back to Viper again. Viper has a Marshall; Jett has a Spectre and a classic.

[00:00:17] So right now the perspective is Reyna. Reyna has just bought an Odin and then sold the Odin and has a marshal. 

[00:00:29] We have changed to red team by the way. 

[00:00:32] Uh, Blue team is on defense and it appears that they have spread. There is Raze and Jett on site A, um, Reyna and Viper on site B and Sage is mid.

[00:00:46] The entire red team has stacked on B and is charging b.

[00:00:51] Sova is droning B.

[00:00:58] Viper has smoked with the one way the, the defending Viper has smoked the one way and the defending Viper has just been killed by both Omen and Jett.

[00:01:15] Defending Raze just dropped a boombot and died up in.

[00:01:24] Uh, okay. So the defending Jett has just killed the attacking Raze with the Spectre

[00:01:36] the perspective has shifted to, uh, the attacking sova and then back to the defending Jett. The attacking sova is now at yellow. 

[00:01:45] Joined in, 

[00:01:48] Attacking sova has just killed Jett while the Jett has rotated to A. The attackers faked an rotate to A site and have gone back to B site while currently the perspective has changed to.

[00:02:09] An external perspective, zooming in on the sage who has a judge and is sitting underneath tubes 

[00:02:16] perspective has changed back and forth between, uh, Jett and Sage

[00:02:23] The attacker Jett has just killed the sage with a Vandal.

[00:02:36] We have now shifted into the perspective of attacking Sova back to the defending team. 

[00:02:46] Switching between everyone on the defending team,

[00:02:54] there are two A, one B. Viper is B. Reyna and Sage are both mid and defending A are Raze and Jett. 

[00:03:07] Jett has just smoked off the site of A to escape.

[00:03:11] Attacking Raze has been blinded by the

[00:03:14] the defending Omen 

[00:03:17] actually the attacking Omen has blinded their teammate? My bad, 

[00:03:23] uh, chaos ensues as everyone is fighting for site a.

[00:03:30] Attacking Sova has just killed the defending sage who has, who had a judge.

[00:03:36] Attacking sova is the only remaining attacker alive. 

[00:03:43] The Jett has just killed the Sova. With a Vandal.

[00:04:03] The Jett has just tossed the gun, has bought a sheriff because the Jett has an ult.

[00:04:12] The defending jet has ult.

[00:04:17] Currently in the perspective of defending Viper, who is a sole person at site B.

[00:04:25] Defending Viper has just picked off, uh, Omen and just died to Jett at B long. 

[00:04:35] Jett has dashed in after smoking B long. 

[00:04:39] And Sage picks off 

[00:04:44] Sage picks someone off with her judge. Um, 

[00:04:48] you have a lot of exchange of, uh, gunfire and, uh, two more casualties on both sides. Sova is droning from yellow and has been spotted by the boom bot while droning

[00:05:04] switch back to defending Jett; now attacking Jett who is pushing through tubes. Under tubes going into tubes.

[00:05:20] Attacking Jett has dropped the spike after getting picked off at Tubes by Raze.

[00:05:29] Sova is fighting. Sova was fighting the Jett with a sheriff for some reason, and Jett has just killed the Sova with a Vandal.
